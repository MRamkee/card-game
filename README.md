# 4 player card game 

Task: 

The goal of this challenge is to produce a beautiful and functional web app that shuffles four hands and determines the number of points a hand is worth in bridge.

# Brief
In bridge a hand may have 13 cards, spread across four suits. The four suits are hearts, spades, clubs and diamonds. The royal cards and aces are worth points
during bidding. An Ace is worth four points, a King is worth three points, a Queen is worth two, and a Jack is worth one. Other cards are not worth points (but are used
in real bidding to determine the contract).

# Problem statement

The task is to generate four face up, hands identifiably belonging to four players (N, E, S, W). Then to calculate the total points in each hand. (Internally to your app, it should be possible to tell points by suit.)

Extra information:
The four players are named after the directions: north and south, east and west. Opposite directions play together, but points are calculated per hand.
Cards are sorted by suit (Spade, Heart, Diamond, Club), then by number, (A, K, Q, J, 10, 9...).
The extension exercise for the coding interview requires that the points by suit are available in your app, even if not shown to the user.
Bridge is played with a standard deck of cards. It has 52 cards, one for every number in every suit.
